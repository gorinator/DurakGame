# DurakGame
Durak game or Fool game - CLI edition.

Written from scratch on C++ just for fun!

I'll be very happy if it will be useful for someone.

Little how to:

Game starts automaticaly and first player for going is thouse that have minimal kozyr in his set.

Navigation and selection is done by entering the number from the keyboard.

There is protection if you have chosen the wrong card for bidding. 

If so, question appeares about taking this card.

You can answer with Yes or No.

Also if computer have no cards for bid, it will ask, would you like to add cards?

You say Yes or No.

If you say Yes, then you can add cards one by one.

After that choose answer No, if you have no more cards for adding.
