# DurakGame
Durak game - CLI edition. Written from scratch on C++ just for fun! 

I'll be very happy if it will be useful for someone.


Little how to:

Game starts automatically and the first player to go is those that have minimal kozyr in his random generated set.

Navigation and selection is done by entering the number from the keyboard.

There is protection if you have chosen the wrong card for bidding. 

If so, a question appears about taking this card.

You can answer with Yes or No.

Same analogue if you chose the wrong card for adding, the corresponding question will be shown.


So if you don't want to add more cards, just enter the number of card that are not in the playing set, and say Yes for question.

Also if the computer has no cards for bid, it will ask, would you like to add cards?

You say Yes or No.

If you say Yes, then you can add cards one by one.

After that choose answer No, if you have no more cards for adding.
